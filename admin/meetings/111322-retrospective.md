# PROs:

- Looking at the skills and contributions of others furthered personal skills for other team members (X2)
    - Note on workflow!
- Fast progress and building interact-able product is motivating and reassuring
- The workload everyone has taken on is generous and everyone’s hard work is appreciated
- The tasks were all accomplished and good communication for those tasks was maintained
- Team has good communication and we maintain good team relationships
- Solid foundation was built so that our tasks for the next sprint are clear
- Everyone is motivated to code which makes the project fun
    - learning attitude helped with team cohesion
- After good communication between teams, effectiveness was increased
- Speed of building was impressive and motivating!
- Research for quality of life / code was able to be prioritized for better future results
- Working with others on our team is a pleasure
- styling and documentation is consistent and detailed (shout out Ernest / Grace!)
- Psychological safety is high!

# DELTAs:

- Not being able to make the weekly meeting feels like missing a lot because so much is accomplished then
- Hard to get started - intimidated to start
- Keeping up with the code from outside the front and back end teams was difficult (lead perspective)
- Disorganization in the beginning contributed to out of synch workflow - no more vague tasks!
- Time management can be tough without information from meetings
- Contributing time is difficult among other responsibilities
- Because we were just getting started, assigning separate tasks is difficult in the beginning
- Starting from a blank page was difficult
- Working on only one computer can be tough to feel your contribution
- QA had a hard time keeping up with development because of the massive amount of new code
- Not much QA work has entered the repo (yet! on its way in)
- WE HAVE A BUS FACTOR! We need to create a situation to allow more cross team communication (X2)
    - Proposed solution: make team channels public so that they can have better communication
- Stand-Up meetings are too early!
    - Proposed solution: 10:30 or later?
- Make sure that there is good communication from leads to devs to TA’s etc!

# Finding Solutions

- We plan to make communicate better between all teams so that everyone is updated on what everyone else is doing. We probably implement different public slack channels where everyone has to post what time their meetings are and what work they were able to complete during that time.
- Stand-up were to early so we going to move the time we do our stand-ups a bit more later on so more people can wake up and go
- For planning we are going to ask for task from each team that they want complete for their next sprint and add/subtract as we seem fix and be more organized to how work gets completed
- Finally we intend to keep good communicate, openness, and understanding so that if anyone ever has a problem they can come to one of the team leads and we can sort through the problem together.
