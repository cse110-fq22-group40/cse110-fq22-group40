# Overall idea

- Let keep it simple
- Let make it user based
- Let make something we all will be happy to work on
- Set boundaries for the project(simple is the goal)
- So with that our idea is‚Ä¶. ‚¨áÔ∏è ‚¨áÔ∏è

## Application for Musicians

### This is compilation of everyone ideas and thought during this process. Thought it would be nice to just grab thoughts/points everyone was writing down

- (MAIN THING) voice memos with note taking feature for music
- allows for users to be more organized
- allows user to annotate their work at what point they like
- allows user to easier re-access their annotated work
- allows user to sharing with others
- focus on the ‚Äúin-progress part of the song‚Äù or whatever work they are doing.
- Desire to sort into sections
- Desire to make notes per recording per time signature
- Connect hub to other users
    - make notes on others recordings
- Track progress, attach files
- Sharing recordings from teacher to student is a example of use
- Having a place to work on in progress works
- Music app for users to annotate their sheets and hear their own recordings
- To connect to social media users can share their workspace to social media
- Problems to solve
    - Assisting private music teachers in analyzing student‚Äôs performance
    - Organization for musicians (Sheet music, recordings, etc)
- How to deal with sharing? Probably do local first then expand to integrated sharing
- First iteration shouldn‚Äôt include API calls and be as simple as possible
- Eventual social media integration: allows professions to share their practice process through social media platforms like Instagram

## GOAL ~ Personal Content Management:

- Post recordings of practice sessions
- Post annotations

### Iterations of the App:

1. Organization
2. Compilation
3. Notation

### Philosophy

- simplicity to reduce scope and broaden user
- look through our competitors and reduce unused features

## Competitors

- MuseScore, SoundCloud, GuitarTabs, Modality
- Competitor apps focus on polished, finished products while our focus is to help with song composition and practice

# Problem and the Solution

## Problem we addressing

- the need to be able to get your real time thoughts, content, and be organized all in one place.
- App for private teachers to track student progress, just a personal local musician app, or professional musicians sharing how they practice and stuff.
- Needs of the user: organization, compilation, note-taking.
- Targeted users: Professionals, teachers, artists, Public speakers.

## Solution we prepose

- an application that can be able to note take on any part of your voice memos that will be able to be organized and work on based to the user likely.
- that is simple to use, and at it‚Äôs core just might to represent a private practice workflow

# What we are not going to do

- compression algorithm for data
- machine learning
- no app feedback or generalization
- all content should be made by user
- work on things that are different from the bare bones of the application
- experiment with different features
- Desktop app - local first!
- no stretch goals before main feature

## Potential Blockers:

- May be hard to limit scope of the project(Main)
- Time
- Some people don‚Äôt have music experience
- UI needs to be done to allow documentation team to finish
- Whole team needs to agree on UI per lead designer

# Breakout-teams

Broke up into teams to discuss applications mood and applications theme. Drawings and docs via different files.

# Group Break Outs

Purpose: (user story, use cases, and personas)

## Group 1: Use Cases

Members: Emmanuel, Billy, Ben, and Alex

Where software can be use

- musicians who want a way to be organize and take real time notes on their songs
- asynchronous teaching to get feedback when not in person from teacher to student.

User input, and how we response

- get user to create a project, then get user to upload audio file. Then user can take notes on that file if they like to in a specific part of the audio. Can take multiple of these notes.

## Group 2: User Story

Members: Kevin, Ryan, Ernest

As a customer, I want a centralized, easy way to organize my musical practices so that I can practice in the most efficient manner.

## Group 3: Persona

Members: Sailor, Ben, and Grace

- Karen (check persona file for more detail).
- They made a whole person who might use the app

# Last Thoughts
