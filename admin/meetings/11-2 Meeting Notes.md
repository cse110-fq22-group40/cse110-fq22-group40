        - MongoDB

                1. Get the timestamp of the currently displaying audio
                2. Create a note string and add it to the current timestamp, and merge the string to the json object after the user hit submit
                3. convert the json object back to string to use local storage (can only store string)
                4. when the website reload, detect if local storage has files and loop through the string to display each note with the according key(timestamp)
        - Building unit test
            - test by function
    - audio saving
        - Object URL
            - test Object URL, try local storage, can save file path successfully
            - try encode the audio to base 64, but with the size limitation of LocalStorage‚Ä¶
        - Blob
        - Local Storage
            - convert the audio file to text file with base 64 string
            - save it to the localstorage
            - indicate the audio source to the audio file when reload and open the text-editor
