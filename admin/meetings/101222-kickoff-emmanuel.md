# Team Name

We put it to a vote and the name we all came to agree upon is Team ….

# LitHub :bulb:

# Team Contract

We were able to come up with a set of rules for the group to follow. They will be published in the group notation. Some examples of the rules were how late we can be to meetings, process of letting go of a assigned tasked, etc. Overall came up with some good rules, just to make sure the team gets things done, and no one really slacks that much!

# Ideas of Video

Was assigned on the script writing team for the group video that we have to film.

- We are Lithub so start out with a light bulb intro.
- lighting could be a big part of the video
- or maybe in fire depends how we see team name
