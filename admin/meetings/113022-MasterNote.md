# What happened

- TA are all on strike still, so we are still unsure what will happen with grading
- Malcom is are official sub as a TA and these are our feedback
    - Our issues look good
    - Only thing we need to organize Github projects
    - Our application looks like one of the best TA ever seen in this course
    - Testing needs to be better coverage from the existing code
    - Then we also need to be able to implement end to end testing as well
    - Readme does not need to take high propriety of class
- QA issues
    - Front end need more code coverage because it has 0% right now
    - We have an issue on windows right now, so maybe ask about that
        - When we have an empty folder it deletes it automatically
        - So ask someone with experience with how this happens
    - Update and delete for notes still needs to be implemented
    - Then rest of resources should be dedicated to end to end testing and testing coverage
- Video
    - Private
        - We have a 15 minutes video to do
        - It should be a tour of our repo
        - So this is why we need Github project set up
    - Public
        - We have a video to do that the whole class will see
        - It will be a fun promo video of our application
        - Have some fun ideas about it
- Documentation
    - We should add file header to css and html files
    - We do not need many inline comments but should have a few

# Closing Thoughts

- Seems like we have a good handle of everything that is coming up
- Only thing team is worry about is testing, yet seems like besides that we do have mostly everything else covered
- Then all in all, we really close to the finish line and we are all glad to finally see all work come together into what will be our final product
- This was the last official team meeting we were going to hold, so peace out¬†‚úåÔ∏è¬†- **Team:** *LitHub üí°*
