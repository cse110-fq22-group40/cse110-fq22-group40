# Onboarding Documentation

## Welcome to Team LitHub!

We are so excited you have decided to join. To get you started, please review this tutorial on accessing and creating a workspace in our [Notion](https://www.notion.so/The-Lit-Hub-24ded023c9f3498b91e11f9db74a3996). This is where we gather to share notes on everything in the class as well as project design and upcoming events.

## Using the Notion

After you have created a workspace and customized it to your liking, you can interact with others in the group by collaborating on notes or creating things for the front page. To add a note to the important notes section of the front page, make sure to select the team your note is relevant to. If you want to create an event on the calendar, add a date and select “agenda” for the note type. If you are holding a meeting, use our agenda template to make sure everyone has all the necessary info to attend. After recording a meeting, be sure to add it to the agenda so it can be seen by the entire team! If you are brainstorming a new idea, you can also check out our shape up template below that can provide a good place to start.

## Links to Resources:

Here are some links to resources from each team. We also have a Miro where we plan and design together and a Figma where we keep our wireframes that can be accessed from the README.md in our repository.
