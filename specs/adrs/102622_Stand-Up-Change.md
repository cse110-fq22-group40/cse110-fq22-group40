## Context and Problem Statement:

Our current stand-up ritual is not serving the team valuable information or good communication. How can we improve to allow the team to communicate better?

## Considered Options:

- Have a 10 minute zoom meeting MWF
- Include a note for the stand-up so that when people have to miss we can keep up with their progress

## Decision Outcomes:

**A remote meeting monday, wednesday, and friday of every week for 10 to 15 minutes will replace the bot in the slack channel. This meeting will include a note where important updates can be written. During the meeting, saying you have little to report or that your tasks are all recorded in the Notion will be allowed.**
