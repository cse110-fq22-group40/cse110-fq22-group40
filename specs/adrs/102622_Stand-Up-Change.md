# Using M/W/F Zoom Meetings to do Weekly Stand-Ups

## Context and Problem Statement

Our current stand-up ritual is not serving the team valuable information or good communication. How can we improve to allow the team to communicate better?

Currently we find the stand-up bot is cluttering our slack notifications making it difficult to discern when you are being contacted. Additionally, we find that the questions asked are too vague and do not encourage discussion between team members. We also worry that when we encounter blockers later in the project, we will not be able to find solutions with our teamates until our team meeting that is held in the middle of the week.

## Decision Drivers

- Daily Slack Bot was providing not useful updates
- Still wanted to be flexiable with meeting times
- Wanted to create better communicationwith all immediate issues or concerns

## Considered Options

- Using M/W/F Zoom Meetings to do Weekly Stand-Ups
- Using M/W/F in-person stand-up meetings after lectures to do Weekly Stand-UPs
- Using a M/W/F note document that would function as our stand-up


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Have a 10 minute zoom meeting MWF" because it allowed us to get the communciation ascept we want more of and allows us to keep some of the versatile ascept we had with the slack bot by being on zoom.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Using M/W/F Zoom Meetings to do Weekly Stand-Ups

- Good, because we get to be able to have two way communication via zoom about any immediate concerns
- Good, because requires everyone to be some what active in the conversation since everyone will be called upon
- Good, because although we will have a set time for the stand up, via zoom we can be flexiable and adapt to different things happening
- Good, because we could record the short stand-up in case anyone could not make it
- Bad, because some members might not be able to show some days
- Bad, because it does not require everyone full active attention and might cause members to coast through the meeting

### Using M/W/F in-person stand-up meetings after lectures to do Weekly Stand-UPs

- Good, because we get to be able to have two way communication in person about any immediate concerns
- Good, because does not allow anyone to be active disengaged with the conversation in person
- Good, because we ill be phyiscally stand up outside class it follows the tradidation format of a standup meeting
- Bad, because not everyone goes to the lectures so might have poor attendence half the time
- Bad, because some of our peers might have different things they have to do right after class

### Using a M/W/F note document that would function as our stand-up

- Good, because it is very flexiable and allows for detailed updated 
- Good, because there is no missing a "standup" meeting
- Bad, because it mostly just one way communication and slow to get two way communication going
- Bad, because we might get the same vague answer we are trying to get away from since it still simple and written

## More Information

Officially we will be having a remote meeting monday, wednesday, and friday of every week for 10 to 15 minutes to replace the bot in the slack channel. This meeting will include a note where important updates can be written. During the meeting, saying you have little to report or that your tasks are all recorded in the Notion will be allowed.
