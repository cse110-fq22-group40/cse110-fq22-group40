## Context and Problem Statement:

Our current stand-up ritual is not serving the team valuable information or good communication. How can we improve to allow the team to communicate better?

Currently we find the stand-up bot is cluttering our slack notifications making it difficult to discern when you are being contacted. Additionally, we find that the questions asked are too vague and do not encourage discussion between team members. We also worry that when we encounter blockers later in the project, we will not be able to find solutions with our teamates until our team meeting that is held in the middle of the week.

## Considered Options:

- Have a 10 minute zoom meeting MWF
- Include a note for the stand-up so that when people have to miss we can keep up with their progress

Although the stand ups are short, we can ensure that more information is being given to the entire team since we can garentee who was able to attend and who was not.

## Decision Outcomes:

**A remote meeting monday, wednesday, and friday of every week for 10 to 15 minutes will replace the bot in the slack channel. This meeting will include a note where important updates can be written. During the meeting, saying you have little to report or that your tasks are all recorded in the Notion will be allowed.**
