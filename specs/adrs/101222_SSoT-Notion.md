# Using Notion as Single Source of Truth (SSoT)

## Context and Problem Statement
Single Source of Truth is suppose to serve as the place where all the our group's work and documents are going to live. So where should that place be?

Towards the beginning of the quarter we told that we should use the github as our Single Source of Truth. However we want a cleaner place but still large place to be our single source of truth so we can put all our documents in. No matter what they were, if they were something related to the group we thought it should live in this Single Source of Truth. So we worry the github might become to clutter for this and began to consider our options.

## Decision Drivers

- Clean and easy way to access own work
- Clean and easy way to share own work
- Clean and easy way to look at others work

## Considered Options

- Github Repository
- Notion
  
## Decision Outcome

Chosen Option: "Notion" because it allows us to have both a clean and easy system to work with. Along with the fact that using notion is in general very pleasing to work and visually looks good.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Github Repository

- Good, because our Github Repository will hold all our code so no need to use two different applications for the project
- Good, because we can ogrizate the github in such as matter that would make our notes easliy accessible
- Bad, because the github might get clutter up with all the groups documentation and might get confusing later into the futre
- Bad, because it would be harder to disguise each members work from each other compared to the other option

### Notion

- Good, because it easy to disguise each members work from each other with the use of workspaces
- Good, because it will be less clutter than other option since we would be using workspaces
- Good, because we can set meeting times, task lists, and make announcement asides from just the general note taking ascept of it
- Good, because it is visually pleasing to work with
- Bad, because we would not have our code and all our documents in the same place 

## More Information

Officially we will be using the Notion as our Single Source of Truth where everyone will have their own workspace to upload their own documents and work. We will be using the notion to make announcements, show meeting times, and make tasks list to go along with putting on work on the notion. Then after every sprint the notino will be backup making it so we can also put it into our github repository as a zip file.
